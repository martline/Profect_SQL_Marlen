# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate acquired skills with SQL, performing analyses on a provided dataset, and provide meaningful context and story behind the results.

## Process
Part 1: Creating database and loading csv Files into Database
Part 2: Data Cleaning
	2.1: Investigating the data and asking the fundamental questions like "What kind of data do we have?" and "What format is the data in?"
Part 3: Starting with Questions
Part 4: Starting with Data
Part 5: QA of data
Part 6: Conclude the results
## Results
After data analyses were performed, I gained many insights on the performance of the website, such as number of sales per country, impact of the of the revenue generated from each city etc.


## Challenges 
Missing a lot of data and not having access to a full dataset was definetely a challenge.
Description of columns was missing, which made it hard to understand the data in certain columns.
In addition, limited amount of time

## Future Goals
1) Do more cleaning of data. Spend more times finding patterns/explanation of missing data
2) Dive more into the data, to ask and answer questions in order to improve efficiency of the site.
